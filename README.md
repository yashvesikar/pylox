# PyLox

This is my implementation of the Lox language that Robert Nystrom has expertly described on his page: [craftinginterpreters.com](craftinginterpreters.com)

This is a work in progress, I chose to implement the first of the 2 interpreters Robert walks through in Python instead of Java because most of the work I do nowadays is in Python. 
I plan to follow the full tutorial, and work on the second more optimized interpreter in C as suggested in the book. 

The aim of this project is 3 part: 
1. Develop a deeper understanding of interpreter and compiler architecture.
2. Develop a deeper understanding of programming language design and the design logic.
3. Work on a challenging PL related project for coding experience and for eventual graduate study in a related field.
